# Peppermint - Business Management Application

What is Peppermint?
- Peppermint is a web application aimed towards small business owners looking for simple and user friendly software to manage business finances, employee wages and schedules.
- It was very important to us that we did not overwhelm the user with a massive amount of features as compared to competition, and in addition, to make the app design simple to use without requiring a large learning curve for the non-tech savvy user.
